# FortuneEightBall
A classic well know is the fortune eight ball, on this project coded during the codeacademy course, I've transformed the original project into a mighty classic the Eight Ball. It's the oldy goody eight ball that will tell you your fortune. It depicts the a few of the powerful and versatile  features of Javascript. Basically, this is how it works, I created an array with the different fortunes a user could have. Then I selected the button using the property "document.getElementById" and the place where the fortune will be displayed on using the same method. Finally, I created a function to randomly generate a number which will be the number used on the next function to decide which fortune will be displayed to the user. Lastly, I selected the elements where the message will be shown and set its content to the number of the array that contained the user's fortune. Pretty simple, yet it was a very good practice.
